WordWars

Introduction:-

The game puts your vocabulary into test.
Challenge your friends to a war of words ,whereby you not only get to showcase your existing vocabulary, but also give it an extra edge.
Be smart since the alphabets are restricted and so will be your chances of framing words you are familiar with.

Rules :-

The game starts with randomly chosen 10 letters which you have to drag and drop on the 10X10 game grid one at a time.
Every time you drop an alphabet ont the game grid, you will be allotted a new randomly chosen letter.
Note that the probability of a given letter to be allotted depends on its frequency in the English language, so it will be moderately difficult to frame common words.
You have to form maximum number of words reading from left to right or top to bottom.
For every word formed by a player in his/her turn, scores will be awarded according to the length of the word(s) formed.
