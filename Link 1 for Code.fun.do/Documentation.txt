The game was designed by Visual Studio Community 2015 using C# and XAML.
The game features a rich adaptive interface to seemlessly fit any screen size.
There are two pages in the game i.e. the FirstPage and the MainPage.
It starts from the FirstPage when the game is launched unlike a common C# application which generally starts from the MainPage and uses Frame.Navigate() method to navigate to the other page.
It is also programmed to randomly select alphabets while simultaneously considering the frequency of each letter in the English language by using a developer-defined frequency array.
The game is event-oriented and considers events like the loading of a page, button click, Drag_Starting, Drag_Over, Drop etc. It uses a Drag & Drop interface which allows users to easily grab characters from the character grid onto the game grid.
Moreover, the app features a beautiful UI, which is appealing to the eye.
